# Qt development task

- We expect you to develop a quick example of the design we provide.
- You can use what ever methods and code to achieve an end result, as long as it can be shown in a browser.
- You can do preparations beforehand, but we expect you to do the final stitching together during the 2nd interview. We expect to see live coding at that time, not just copy/paste. You will have about 30min time to do it then.
- Be prepared to tell us about reasons why you chose to do it the way you did at the interview. You may wish to create a separate document about it, if needed. We expect you to create some interactions based on the assumptions that come out of the design. Feel free to suggest additional structures and changes. Not all in the design needs to be created, you can also pick some essentials, which would show off your skills. For ex
  - Open a file from local/cloud through the file menu
  - Interact with layer panel
  - Resize/manipulate image/UI elements (it does not have to be a cat) 3D?
  - Wow us!
- Pay attention to the code quality, as we expect to see the code, too.
- Design can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/deaeed76-f166-4e85-a00c-dd7a72b04f17-8bfd/)
- You can also find images and other artifacts in the zip folder.
